# description
    I want my game to be a "ecosystem simulation". The game is supposed to be able to play itself but can be influenced by the "observer" -the player. The observers needs to watch the ecosystem and see what happens. He can influence the game by changing the environment or dinos. For example he can decide to remove food/water, create more dangers or create/remove dinos.

    more mechanics:
    the game is top down view
    Place/remove area/items/dinos.
    change amount of hunger/thirst
    change weather

    This game is for people just interested in a small demo about dinos walking around.

    for simplicity i will probably use figures or pixel art as style

# Why this game?
    I am making this game because i always wanted to make a game where i have AI animals/dino which i can influence to create a custom ecosystem. Another reason i am making this game because i got a told i am using to much pre written code (which i wasn't). To prove i am able to write programs to a certain degree i am going to write this code limiting myself to only using books/documentation. I might inspire myself watching gameplay based youtube videos, but i won't watch tutorials or coding explanation videos. I hope this way i get better at programming and show i am able to create programs without pre written code.

    I am inspired by games like: 
        ark survival evolved (600 hours played)
        rust (2.9k hours played)
        dayz (123 hours played)
        Stardew Valley (Girlfriend played 26 hours and talked about it)
